You can use custom Flutter versions (forks) within FVM cache.

FVM will use and run any directory that inside the cache version directory. If there is a version called {custom_name} you are able to do the following.

```bash
fvm use {custom_name}
```

:::tip
Run `fvm list` to view the cache directory, and the current cached versions.
